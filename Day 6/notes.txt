WebAPI developer
1. Creates an API ( We did it with collections and database)
2. Consume an API in frontend application 
	a. Client Side Consumption
		fetch api (a standard by W3C - an api built into the modern browsers)
			returns a promise - script it useing try(then) catch block

			fastest way to get the data - less secure
	b. Server Side Consumption
		HttpClient - also a W3C standard 
			Safest way to get the data - little bit slower
